# FFXII Randomizer Tracker

Get the randomizer [here](https://github.com/Bartz24/FFModdingWPF/blob/0.8/FF12Rando/bin/build/FF12RandomizerPreview.7z).  This version of the tracker is built for version 0.8.1.17 of the stand-alone randomizer / version 0.4.0 of the Archipelago world.

## Before Using

Make sure to adjust the Settings tab (next to Characters) to match your settings.  This will allow you to enable/disable locations like hunts and clan rewards if you are not shuffling them.

Note that the number of chests on each screen is random, so chest locations have been grouped together by logical accessibility.
